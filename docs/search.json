I will decide whether to cover an introduction to the R language later in time.\nThis work is for myself. It is the result of all the things that I learned about R, RStudio, and Tidyverse during the past years, and hopefully I will learn more while writing it. However, if you happen to land here, then feel free to have a look. And if find that there is a problem, then please submit an Issue on the GitHub repository of the book.\nThis book was written with RStudio IDE using Quarto. The website is hosted via GitHub Pages. The complete source is available on GitHub."

    "text": "Tidyverse is a collection of R packages designed to manipulate and visualise a variety of different data formats. Tidiverse packages work well together by adopting a consistent approach from both a syntactical and an operational point of view.\nQuoting the official Tidyverse website\n\nThe tidyverse is an opinionated collection of R packages designed for data science. All packages share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures.\n\nIn other words, the mission of Tidyverse is to provide a toolbox of functions that are easy to remember and intuitive to use."
