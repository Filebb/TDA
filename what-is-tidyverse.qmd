**Tidyverse** is a collection of R packages designed to manipulate and visualise
a variety of different data formats. Tidiverse packages work well together by
adopting a consistent approach from both a syntactical and an operational point
of view.

Quoting the official [website](https://www.tidyverse.org/)

> The tidyverse is an opinionated collection of R packages designed for data
> science. All packages share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data
> structures.

In other words, the mission of Tidyverse is to provide a toolbox of functions
that are easy to remember and intuitive to use.
